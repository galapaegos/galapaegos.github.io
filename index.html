				<p>Looking for a passionate software engineer focused on performance and results?  With over 15 years of professional experience, I am a dedicated software engineer with a focus on optimization and performance. To see some of the Please visit the <a href="experience.html">experience</a> page for more information.</p>
				<p>Here are some examples of software I have helped developed.</p>

				<h1>Virtual Temporal Bone Surgery Simulator</h1>
				<p>Perform virtual ear surgery using 3D force-feedback devices. Subjects remove bone using virtual representations of surgical instruments, see volume removed instantly, and flush out blood with the use of a fluid simulation. This software has been distributed to an international consortium with over 15 institutes.</p>
				<p>The virtual simulation is written in C++, and heavily utilizes GPU technology to provide a realistic experience. The simulation relies on multithreading with specifically timed data transfers to utilize both CPU and GPU. The overlying simulation framework utilizes a JavaScript scripting engine to provide the user with a custom interface for site specific interactions.</p>
				<p>The latest version features the ability to load patient-specific datasets for surgical rehearsal.</p>

				<h1>Interactive Virtual Environments</h1>
				<p>Combining consumer VR headsets with motion tracking cameras, IVE is a sophisticated environment for interacting and exploring different types of data without being limited by a tether.</p>
				<p>The IVE system uses OptiTrack cameras for tracking, an Oculus Rift for visuals, connected to laptop-backpack for computation. Different environments were developed using Unity but these lacked the realism, then implemented these rooms using Unreal Engine.</p>

				<h1>Cell-X</h1>
				<p>Grow cells, automatically identify cells and move these cultures to other dishes automatically.</p>
				<p>This software is primarily written in python, with an emphasis on the user interface to the hardware.</p>

				<h1>Nasal simulation</h1>
				<p>Olfactory surgical simulation to test surgical intervention for air flow through nasal cavity. This tool loads patient-specific datasets and allows for removal within the sinuses. Currently, this information is exported to be used for air flow analysis using an offline CFD simulation.</p>

				<h1>GooFit</h1>
				<p>GooFit is a high-energy physics application where I improved GPU performance by over 50% for the latest GPU technology. These performance improvements relied on improving the memory access patterns. In addition, I was able to explore the feasibility of using embedding kernel calls within templated classes to allow for combining CUDA kernels into different arrangements at compile time.</p>

				<h1>VolEditor</h1>
				<p>VolEditor is a 3D painting tool, allowing for arbitrary rotation, translation, zooming of 3D volumetric datasets. A simple point-click interface allows a user to segment regions of the dataset with different segment values.</p>

				<h1>MansionsVR</h1>
				<p>MansionsVR is a side project I am developing in my freetime. Mansions VR is a single player Virtual Reality game in which the player has to escape the mansions. The mansion layout is dynamically generated, and each scenario is dynamically generated allowing for replayability. Currently, this project is being developed using Unreal Engine.</p>
